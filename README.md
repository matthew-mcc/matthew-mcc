Hi! My name is Matthew McConnell and I am a undergraduate student at the University of Calgary studying a Bsc in Computer Science and a Bsc in Architecture!

About me:
I am a passionate and independent learner who loves to spend time programming. I have always had a passion for computers building my first computer at 13 and have built many more since then. I transitioned my knowledge of computers to architecture and won two scholarships through BILD Calgary for my digital designs. My expertise lies in Python where I am fully capable of solving complex physics simulations, developing data analysis and visualization tools, working with multiple packages and framework tools, and the creation of graphical user interfaces. 

My hobbies include video games, programming, guitar and music! I have played rugby for most of my young-teen / adult life, and played at a high level at the University of Calgary, as well as clubs and city teams. I also enjoy working on vehicles, particularily the many trucks I have had through the year.
