Hi! My name is Matthew McConnell and I am a graduate student at the University of Calgary studying a Msc in Computer Science!

About me:
I am a passionate and independent learner who loves to spend time programming. I have always had a passion for computers building my first computer at 13 and have built many more since then. Currently, I am researching applied Artificial Intelligence with respect to video games. This github includes many personal projects, completed projects for research and many unfinished projects! 

My hobbies include video games, programming, guitar and music! I have played rugby for most of my young-teen / adult life, and played at a high level at the University of Calgary, as well as clubs and city teams. I also enjoy working on vehicles, particularily the many trucks I have had through the year.
